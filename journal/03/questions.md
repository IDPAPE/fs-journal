# Application Architecture, MVC Design Pattern
01. What are the Pillars of Object Oriented Programming (`OOP`)?
  
  > Abstraction- rather than having one big function do a lot of things you should break it up into smaller functions with descriptive names that can be reused many times, this allows for easier code maintainance in the future, since you only need to understand how the smaller functions can be implemented, rather than having to read through all of the code to understand how something works
    Encapsulation- each object of your code should control its own state, the individual parts of your code should have very limited access to data elsewhere in your code. Things that are not required for a certain task should not be accessible, as this can lead to privacy issues or strange errors with your code
    Inheritance- lets one object inherit properties and methods from another object. This is basically saying that your parent classes should only have children that are highly related to them, if you are trying to add things that are not related to the parent class, maybe you should be making a new parent class
    Polymorphism- The condition of existing in multiple different forms. This seems like it goes hand in hand with inheritance. Parent classes and their children class should be able to do similar things under the same name. Example: animal.makeNoise() is the default, dog.makeNoise() can be called in the same way but has a more specific output than it's parent
