    > S — Single responsibility principle: Classes should have only one job.
      O — Open closed principle: Objects should be open for extension but closed for modification, This means that you should be able to extend the functionality of a function without modifying the function's code. How I understand this is that rather than rewriting your function to add functionality, your functions should be built in a way that you can create a new function that can be call or be called by your old function to add functionality
      L — Liskov substitution principle
      I — Interface segregation principle
      D — Dependency Inversion principle
